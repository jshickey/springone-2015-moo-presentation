The full description of the kata is located at http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR

.Kata is broken up into 4 stories.

* convert OCR account to a numeric decimal string

* compute a checksum to make sure the account is valid

* handle illegible characters by using ? as a placeholder
